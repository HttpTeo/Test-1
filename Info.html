							<h2>Why 	LSPU?<br> 
							</h2>
						</header>
						<p>The best reason i have why i pick LSPU is because LSPU is a state university where being a state university, LSPU is subsidized by the government, which means lower tuition fees and more resources for students. Another reason is The location of the campus is same as my address and its few blocks away from my home. Lspu also provides a quality of education where back when i was senior high at LSPU, most teachers or professors teach their students at a different level. They emphasize student learning while maintaining engagement with them. I've seen a lot of potential that the LSPU has and these are very benifitial to some students like me.</p>

							<h2>Why CSS?<br> 
							</h2>
						</header>
						<p>If im being honest, CCS/IT is just my 3rd option of corse. When i was graduated at my senior high, i was thinking deeply on what course i will pic. The first thing that struck at my mind si architechtural drafting because I have potential in drawing, not that good but I can keep up, unfortunately I didn't get into architectural drafting because there is no more slot for enrollment. The 2nd choice is the criminology because I also dreamed of serving the people and defending the oppressed, unfortunately my parents did not allow me. And this is the reason why I am in the CCS or Information Technology course, at first it was difficult for me to keep up because my knowledge in the IT industry was limited but as time went on I learned and I can keep up, I also saw the beauty of our course because in some professions that can be obtained.</p>
